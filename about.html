            <h3>Hi! I'm Kobus!</h3>
            <p>I design, code and modify websites, from layout to function and according to your specifications. I strive to create visually appealing sites that feature user-friendly designs and clear navigation.</p>
            <h4>What can I do for you?</h4>
            <p>Do you need a website? I create well designed and functional websites thats easy to use and optimized for mobile use, featuring fresh and quality content with readily accessible location and contact information. </p>
            <p>Having a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/kobusvs92/responsive-web-design"> Web Design certificate</a> does not mean that it's all I can do. I'm constantly learning and working to expand my knowledge and provide more services. </p>
            <h4>Get to know me.</h4>
            <p>I started my coding journey back in 2019 out of curiosity. I did my studies and courses on freecodecamp while working a full time job. </p>
